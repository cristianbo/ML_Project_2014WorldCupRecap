STA 561 Machine Learning Project (2014 World Cup Recap)

Hi guys, this is our course project of STA 561 Probabilistic Machine Learning(Fall 2015). Our topic is 2014 World Cup Recap. By building 
the Bayesian linear regression and probit model and collecting the data from the World Cup, UEFA European Championships, Copa Am√©rica in 
the last 20 years, we predict the results of the elimination games of 2014 World Cup and compare the predictions with the real results of
2014 World Cup.

In the repository, the Project Proposal is our idea and plans about the whole project. The Project Poster can give you a visually picture 
of the whole project. In the Project Report, it shows all the detailed process of building models, collecting data and doing inference of 
our project.
