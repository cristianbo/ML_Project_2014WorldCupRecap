Duke STA 561 Machine Learning Project, 2014 World Cup Recap, Weichen Ning & Wen Bo

Hi guys, this is our course project of STA 561 Probabilistic Machine Learning (Fall 2015). Our topic is 2014 World Cup Recap. By building
the Bayesian linear regression & probit model and collecting the game statistics from the World Cup, UEFA European Championships, Copa Am√©rica in the last 20 years, we predict the results of the elimination games of 2014 World Cup and compare the predictions with the real results of 2014 World Cup.

In the repository, the Project Proposal is our idea and plans about the whole project. The Project Poster can give you a visually picture
of the whole project. In the Project Report, it shows all the detailed process of building models, collecting data and doing inference of
our project.
